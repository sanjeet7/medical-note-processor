CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS MANAGEMENT

Version 3.2 | Updated: December 2024

====================
1. INTRODUCTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
====================

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects over 537 million adults worldwide and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and comprehensive management of T2DM in primary care, with emphasis on individualized glycemic targets and cardiovascular risk reduction.

====================
2. SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS
====================

Screening Recommendations (ADA 2024):
- Screen all adults age ≥ 35 years regardless of risk factors
- Screen earlier and more frequently if risk factors present:
  * BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² (≥ 23 kg/m² in Asian Americans)
  * First-degree relative with diabetes
  * High-risk race/ethnicity (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
  * History of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome
  * Physical inactivity
  * Hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg or on therapy)
  * HDL < 35 mg/dL or triglycerides > 250 mg/dL
  * Prediabetes on prior testing

Diagnostic Criteria (any of the following):
1. Hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% (confirmed on repeat testing if asymptomatic)
2. Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (8-hour fast)
3. 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
4. Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia

Prediabetes Criteria:
- HbA1c 5.7-6.4%
- Fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose)
- 2-hour OGTT glucose 140-199 mg/dL (impaired glucose tolerance)
- Prediabetes patients require lifestyle intervention and annual diabetes screening

====================
3. INITIAL COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION
====================

Medical History:
- Duration of hyperglycemia symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss)
- Previous HbA1c results and glucose monitoring data
- Eating patterns, nutritional status, weight history
- Physical activity level
- History of diabetes-related complications
- Family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
- Current medications (including over-the-counter)
- Tobacco, alcohol, substance use
- Psychosocial assessment (depression screening)

Physical Examination:
- Height, weight, BMI calculation
- Blood pressure measurement
- Comprehensive foot examination (monofilament testing, pulses, visual inspection)
- Skin examination (acanthosis nigricans, lipodystrophy)
- Fundoscopic examination or retinal photography referral

Laboratory Assessment at Diagnosis:
- HbA1c (if not used for diagnosis)
- Fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
- Liver function tests (AST, ALT)
- Serum creatinine with eGFR calculation
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
- TSH in type 1 diabetes or if symptoms suggest thyroid disorder
- Vitamin B12 if on metformin long-term

====================
4. GLYCEMIC TARGETS
====================

General Recommendations:
- Glycemic targets should be individualized based on:
  * Duration of diabetes
  * Age and life expectancy
  * Comorbid conditions
  * Established vascular complications
  * Hypoglycemia risk
  * Patient preferences and resources

Target HbA1c Levels:
- Most non-pregnant adults: < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol)
- More stringent (< 6.5%): Selected patients with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD, if achieved without significant hypoglycemia
- Less stringent (< 8.0%): History of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbidities, long-standing diabetes with difficulty achieving lower targets

Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) Targets:
- Preprandial glucose: 80-130 mg/dL
- Postprandial glucose (1-2 hours after meals): < 180 mg/dL
- Bedtime glucose: 100-140 mg/dL

Time in Range (TIR) for CGM Users:
- TIR (70-180 mg/dL): > 70% of time
- Time below range (< 70 mg/dL): < 4% of time
- Time above range (> 180 mg/dL): < 25% of time

====================
5. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS
====================

Medical Nutrition Therapy:
- Individualized meal planning with emphasis on nutrient-dense foods
- Carbohydrate quality and quantity:
  * Choose whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes over refined carbohydrates
  * Consider carbohydrate counting for insulin users
  * Low-carbohydrate eating patterns may benefit some patients
- Protein intake: 15-20% of calories (higher if kidney disease absent)
- Fat intake: Emphasize unsaturated fats, limit saturated fat to < 7% calories
- Mediterranean or DASH eating patterns recommended
- Limit sugar-sweetened beverages
- Portion control strategies

Weight Management:
- Weight loss of 5-10% improves glycemic control, blood pressure, lipids
- For overweight/obese patients: target 500-750 kcal/day deficit
- Intensive behavioral interventions most effective
- Consider anti-obesity medications if BMI ≥ 27 with comorbidities
- Bariatric surgery consideration if BMI ≥ 35 (≥ 32.5 in Asian Americans)

Physical Activity:
- Aerobic exercise: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity (50-70% max heart rate)
- Spread over at least 3 days with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity
- Resistance training: 2-3 sessions per week on non-consecutive days
- Avoid prolonged sitting; break up sitting time every 30 minutes
- Flexibility and balance training for older adults

Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES):
- All patients should receive DSMES at diagnosis and ongoing
- Key topics: medication adherence, hypoglycemia recognition, sick day management, foot care
- Utilize certified diabetes educators when available

====================
6. PHARMACOTHERAPY - MEDICATION SELECTION
====================

First-Line Therapy - Metformin:
- Initiate metformin at diagnosis unless contraindications present
- Dosing: Start 500 mg once or twice daily with meals; titrate to 2000-2550 mg/day divided doses
- Mechanism: Reduces hepatic glucose production, improves insulin sensitivity
- Benefits: Weight neutral or modest weight loss, low hypoglycemia risk, cardiovascular neutral, low cost
- Side effects: GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea) - use extended-release formulation if needed
- Contraindications: eGFR < 30 mL/min, severe liver disease, acute metabolic acidosis
- Monitor vitamin B12 annually with long-term use

Second-Line Therapy Selection - Individualized Approach:

FOR PATIENTS WITH ESTABLISHED ATHEROSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (ASCVD):
- Preferred: GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefit OR SGLT2 inhibitor with proven CV benefit
- Independent of HbA1c, metformin use, or baseline HbA1c

FOR PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE OR CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:
- Preferred: SGLT2 inhibitor with evidence of reducing HF/CKD progression
- Consider GLP-1 RA if SGLT2i contraindicated or not tolerated

FOR PATIENTS WITH OBESITY (BMI ≥ 27) AND NO ASCVD/HF/CKD:
- Preferred: GLP-1 receptor agonist (promotes weight loss)
- Alternative: SGLT2 inhibitor

FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT INDICATORS FOR SPECIFIC DRUG CLASS:
- Consider: Cost, side effect profile, patient preference
- Options: DPP-4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 RA, sulfonylurea, TZD

Medication Classes - Detailed Overview:

1. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Incretin Mimetics)
   - Examples: Semaglutide (Ozempic) 0.5-2 mg SC weekly; Dulaglutide (Trulicity) 0.75-4.5 mg SC weekly; Liraglutide (Victoza) 0.6-1.8 mg SC daily
   - Mechanism: Enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon, delays gastric emptying
   - HbA1c reduction: 0.8-1.8%
   - Weight effect: -2 to -6 kg (dose-dependent)
   - CV benefits: Reduced MACE in high-risk patients (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide)
   - Side effects: Nausea (usually transient), diarrhea, vomiting
   - Contraindications: Personal/family history of medullary thyroid cancer or MEN 2
   - Cautions: Pancreatitis risk (rare), slow dose titration to minimize GI effects

2. SGLT2 Inhibitors (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors)
   - Examples: Empagliflozin (Jardiance) 10-25 mg daily; Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) 5-10 mg daily; Canagliflozin (Invokana) 100-300 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Blocks renal glucose reabsorption, increases urinary glucose excretion
   - HbA1c reduction: 0.5-1.0%
   - Weight effect: -2 to -3 kg
   - CV/renal benefits: Reduced heart failure hospitalization, slowed CKD progression, reduced CV death
   - Side effects: Genital mycotic infections (10-15%), urinary tract infections, polyuria
   - Rare but serious: Diabetic ketoacidosis (usually euglycemic), volume depletion, fournier gangrene
   - Cautions: eGFR < 20-30 (varies by agent), initiation may transiently decrease eGFR

3. DPP-4 Inhibitors (Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors)
   - Examples: Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg daily; Linagliptin (Tradjenta) 5 mg daily; Saxagliptin (Onglyza) 5 mg daily

   - HbA1c reduction: 0.5-0.8%
   - Weight effect: Neutral
   - Side effects: Generally well-tolerated, nasopharyngitis
   - Cautions: Saxagliptin associated with increased heart failure risk

4. Sulfonylureas
   - Examples: Glipizide 5-20 mg daily/divided; Glyburide 1.25-20 mg daily/divided; Glimepiride 1-8 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Stimulates pancreatic insulin secretion
   - HbA1c reduction: 1.0-1.5%
   - Weight effect: +2 to +3 kg
   - Side effects: HYPOGLYCEMIA (major concern), weight gain
   - Low cost but falling out of favor due to hypoglycemia risk
   - Cautions: Elderly, renal impairment (avoid glyburide)

5. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
   - Example: Pioglitazone 15-45 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Improves insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue
   - HbA1c reduction: 0.8-1.4%
   - Weight effect: +2 to +4 kg
   - Side effects: Edema, weight gain, fracture risk (especially women)
   - Contraindications: Heart failure (black box warning), bladder cancer
   - Benefits: Durable glycemic effect, may reduce fatty liver

6. Basal Insulin
   - Examples: Glargine U-100/U-300, Detemir, Degludec U-100/U-200
   - Initiate when: HbA1c > 10%, glucose > 300 mg/dL, or symptomatic hyperglycemia despite oral agents
   - Starting dose: 10 units daily or 0.1-0.2 units/kg
   - Titrate: Increase 2-4 units every 3 days until fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL
   - HbA1c reduction: 1.5-2.5% (dose-dependent)
   - Side effects: Hypoglycemia, weight gain (+2-4 kg)

====================
7. TREATMENT INTENSIFICATION
====================

Triple Therapy:
- If HbA1c remains above target on dual therapy, add third agent from different class
- Preferred combinations often include metformin + GLP-1 RA + SGLT2i (if appropriate)

Injectable Therapy:
- Consider GLP-1 RA before basal insulin (less hypoglycemia, weight loss benefit)
- Basal insulin indicated if: Severe hyperglycemia (A1c > 10%), catabolic symptoms, concern for type 1 diabetes

Insulin Intensification:
- If basal insulin at adequate dose (0.5 units/kg) but HbA1c still elevated:
  * Add prandial insulin (1-2 injections) before largest meals
  * Consider GLP-1 RA + basal insulin combination
  * Progress to basal-bolus regimen if needed

====================
8. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK MANAGEMENT
====================

Blood Pressure Management:
- Target: < 130/80 mm Hg for most patients
- First-line agents: ACE inhibitor or ARB (renoprotective in diabetes)
- Additional agents as needed to achieve goal

Lipid Management:
- Statin therapy for most adults with diabetes age 40-75
- High-intensity statin if ASCVD present or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%
- Moderate-intensity statin for moderate risk
- LDL goal: < 70 mg/dL (< 100 mg/dL for moderate risk)
- Consider ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor if not at goal on maximally tolerated statin

Antiplatelet Therapy:
- Aspirin 75-162 mg daily for patients with diabetes and ASCVD
- Consider for primary prevention if age ≥ 50 and additional CV risk factor, without increased bleeding risk

====================
9. COMPLICATION SCREENING AND PREVENTION
====================

Diabetic Retinopathy:
- Initial dilated eye exam: at diagnosis
- Follow-up: Annually if no retinopathy; more frequently if abnormalities present
- Optimal glycemic and blood pressure control reduces risk

Diabetic Kidney Disease:
- Annual screening: eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
- If albuminuria present: ACE inhibitor or ARB
- SGLT2 inhibitor for eGFR 20-60 with albuminuria (proven to slow progression)
- Nephrology referral if eGFR < 30 or rapidly declining

Diabetic Neuropathy:
- Screen at diagnosis and annually with monofilament test and vibration sensation
- Foot inspection at every visit
- Gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for painful neuropathy
- Emphasize foot care education

Cardiovascular Disease:
- ECG at baseline if CV risk factors present
- Consider stress testing in high-risk patients before starting exercise program
- Aggressive CV risk factor modification

====================
10. MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP
====================

HbA1c Testing:
- Every 3 months if not at goal or therapy changed
- Every 6 months if stable and at goal

Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose:
- Frequency individualized based on therapy:
  * Insulin users: Before meals and bedtime, occasionally 2 hours postprandial
  * Non-insulin users: Individualized; may not need daily testing
- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) increasingly utilized, especially for insulin users

Office Visits:
- Newly diagnosed or not at goal: Every 3 months
- Stable and at goal: Every 6 months minimum
- Each visit: Review SMBG/CGM data, medication adherence, hypoglycemia episodes, lifestyle modifications
- Comprehensive foot exam at least annually

Patient Education:
- Hypoglycemia recognition and treatment (15-15 rule: 15g fast-acting carbs, recheck in 15 min)
- Sick day management (maintain hydration, monitor glucose frequently, when to call provider)
- When to seek emergency care (glucose > 300 with ketones, severe hypoglycemia)

====================
11. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
====================

Older Adults:
- Higher risk of hypoglycemia, polypharmacy, comorbidities
- Individualize targets: HbA1c 7.5-8.5% may be appropriate for complex/frail elderly
- Avoid sulfonylureas if possible
- Simplify regimens, assess functional and cognitive status

Hospitalized Patients:
- Target glucose: 140-180 mg/dL for most critically ill and non-critically ill patients
- Insulin preferred for inpatient glycemic management
- Transition plan critical at discharge

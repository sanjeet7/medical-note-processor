CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE: POST-SURGICAL CARE AND RECOVERY MANAGEMENT

Version 1.8 | Updated: December 2024

====================
1. INTRODUCTION
====================

Post-operative care is a critical phase in the surgical continuum, significantly influencing patient outcomes, recovery time, and complication rates. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing patients in the post-surgical period across various surgical procedures, with emphasis on pain management, wound care, mobilization, prevention of complications, and patient education for optimal recovery.

====================
2. IMMEDIATE POST-OPERATIVE ASSESSMENT (PACU/Recovery Room)
====================

Initial Monitoring (First 2-4 Hours):
- Vital signs every 15 minutes initially, then per protocol
- Airway patency and respiratory status
- Level of consciousness and neurological status
- Surgical site assessment for bleeding
- Pain level assessment (0-10 scale)
- Nausea/vomiting assessment
- Intake and output monitoring

Monitoring Frequency:
- Vital signs should be monitored every 15 minutes for the first hour (or until stable)
- Every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours
- Every 4 hours thereafter on the ward (or per protocol)

Discharge Criteria from PACU:
- Stable vital signs for at least 30 minutes
- Alert and oriented (or returned to baseline mental status)
- Adequate pain control
- Minimal nausea/vomiting
- Controlled surgical site bleeding
- Ability to move all extremities (if applicable)
- Adequate oxygen saturation on room air (unless baseline oxygen requirement)

====================
3. PAIN MANAGEMENT - MULTIMODAL APPROACH
====================

Principles of Post-Operative Pain Management:
- Multimodal analgesia: Use multiple medication classes with different mechanisms to minimize opioid requirements
- Pre-emptive analgesia: Address pain before it becomes severe
- Individualized approach: Consider procedure type, patient factors (age, renal function, history of substance use)
- Regular assessment: Pain scores documented every 4 hours minimum
- Patient education: Set realistic expectations, involve patients in pain management decisions

Pain Assessment Tools:
- Numeric Rating Scale (0-10): Most common for adults
- Wong-Baker FACES scale: Useful for children or communication barriers
- FLACC scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability): Non-verbal patients
- Critical Action Pain Score (CAPS): Assess pain with movement/deep breathing

Multimodal Analgesic Regimen:

Non-Opioid Foundation:

1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
   - Dosing: 650-1000 mg PO every 6 hours (max 4 grams/24 hours)
   - IV formulation: 1 gram every 6 hours (useful immediate post-op if NPO)
   - Mechanism: Central analgesic and antipyretic effect
   - Benefits: Opioid-sparing, well-tolerated
   - Cautions: Hepatic impairment, chronic alcohol use (reduce dose to max 2 g/day)

2. NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)
   - Examples: Ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO every 6-8 hours; Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV/IM every 6 hours (max 5 days)
   - Mechanism: Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reduce inflammation
   - Benefits: Effective for musculoskeletal and inflammatory pain
   - Contraindications: Active PUD, significant renal impairment (eGFR < 30), bleeding disorders, recent cardiac surgery
   - Cautions: GI bleeding risk (consider PPI if high risk), perioperative bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal dysfunction
   - Monitor: Renal function, signs of bleeding

3. Gabapentinoids (Gabapentin, Pregabalin)
   - Dosing: Gabapentin 300-600 mg PO every 8 hours; Pregabalin 75-150 mg PO twice daily
   - Mechanism: Modulate calcium channels, reduce neuropathic pain
   - Benefits: Opioid-sparing effect, reduce neuropathic pain component
   - Side effects: Sedation, dizziness, peripheral edema
   - Cautions: Renal dosing adjustment required
   - Evidence: Most effective when started pre-operatively and continued post-op

Opioid Analgesics (Rescue and Breakthrough Pain):

Short-Acting Opioids:
- Morphine: 2-10 mg IV/IM every 3-4 hours OR 15-30 mg PO every 4 hours
- Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 0.5-2 mg IV/IM every 3-4 hours OR 2-4 mg PO every 4-6 hours (5-7x more potent than morphine)
- Oxycodone: 5-10 mg PO every 4-6 hours
- Hydrocodone: 5-10 mg PO every 4-6 hours (combination products with acetaminophen)

Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA):
- Indications: Major surgery, severe pain, patients able to self-administer
- Typical settings: Morphine 1 mg demand dose, 6-10 minute lockout, no basal rate (or low basal if needed)
- Benefits: Better pain control, patient autonomy, reduced nursing workload
- Monitoring: Sedation level (primary safety concern), respiratory rate, pain scores
- Discontinue when oral intake resumed and pain controlled with oral medications

Opioid Side Effect Management:
- Constipation (most common): Prophylactic bowel regimen (stool softener + stimulant laxative) for all patients on opioids
- Nausea/vomiting: Ondansetron 4-8 mg every 6 hours, metoclopramide 10 mg, promethazine 12.5-25 mg
- Pruritus: Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg, or reduce opioid dose, or switch opioids
- Respiratory depression: Reduce or hold dose, naloxone 0.04-0.4 mg IV if severe (titrate to avoid complete reversal and severe pain)

Regional Anesthesia and Nerve Blocks:
- Benefits: Superior pain control, reduced opioid use, fewer side effects
- Examples: Epidural catheters (thoracic/abdominal surgery), peripheral nerve blocks (orthopedic surgery), TAP blocks (abdominal surgery)
- Duration: Single-shot blocks last 8-24 hours; continuous catheters can last several days
- Monitoring: Assess motor/sensory function, catheter site if applicable

Procedure-Specific Considerations:
- Orthopedic surgery: Emphasize NSAIDs (if safe), regional blocks, ice therapy
- Abdominal surgery: Avoid excessive opioids (ileus risk), multimodal approach critical
- Thoracic surgery: Epidural or paravertebral blocks effective
- Minimally invasive surgery: Often lower pain, but still require adequate analgesia

Transitioning to Outpatient Pain Management:
- Discharge prescription: Short course (3-7 days) of opioid + non-opioid combination
- Example: Oxycodone 5 mg + acetaminophen 325 mg, dispense 15-30 tablets, no refills
- Educate on weaning: Decrease opioid first, maintain non-opioid analgesics
- Set expectations: Some discomfort normal during recovery, avoid complete pain elimination goal
- Safe storage and disposal: Discuss risks, provide disposal resources

====================
4. WOUND CARE AND INFECTION PREVENTION
====================

Surgical Site Assessment:
- Inspect daily: Edges approximated, no dehiscence, no purulent drainage
- Signs of infection (usually appears POD 3-7): Erythema, warmth, swelling, purulent drainage, fever
- Document: Appearance, size, drainage type/amount

Wound Classification:
- Clean (Class I): Uninfected, no inflammation, no GI/GU/respiratory tract entry
- Clean-contaminated (Class II): GI/GU/respiratory tract entered under controlled conditions
- Contaminated (Class III): Open/traumatic wounds, major breaks in sterile technique, GI spillage
- Dirty (Class IV): Purulent infection, perforated viscus, traumatic wound with devitalized tissue

Dressing Management:

Primary Dressings (Clean, Dry Wounds):
- Initial dressing: Leave in place for 24-48 hours unless concerns for bleeding/infection
- After 48 hours: May shower with incision exposed (pat dry gently)
- No soaking: Avoid baths, swimming pools, hot tubs until fully healed (typically 2-3 weeks)
- If drainage persists: Change dressings daily or twice daily, keep clean and dry
- Surgical glue (Dermabond): No dressing needed, will peel off in 5-10 days
- Steri-strips: Leave in place, will fall off naturally in 7-14 days

Wound Drainage Devices:
- Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains, Hemovac drains: Empty every 8-12 hours or when 2/3 full
- Document output: Amount, color, character
- Removal criteria: < 30 mL/24 hours for 24-48 hours (varies by procedure)
- Patient education: Emptying technique, securing drain, signs of problems

Suture/Staple Removal:
- Timing varies by location and tension:
  * Face: 3-5 days
  * Scalp: 7-10 days
  * Trunk/upper extremities: 7-10 days
  * Lower extremities/joints: 10-14 days
- Technique: Every other suture/staple first, assess wound integrity, remove remainder if appropriate

Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Prevention:
- Pre-operative: Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis (within 60 minutes of incision)
- Intra-operative: Maintain normothermia, glucose control, appropriate skin preparation
- Post-operative: Hand hygiene, aseptic dressing changes, glycemic control
- Risk factors: Diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression, malnutrition, smoking, prolonged surgery

SSI Recognition and Management:
- Superficial incisional SSI: Erythema, warmth, tenderness, purulent drainage limited to skin/subcutaneous tissue
  * Treatment: Open wound if needed, local wound care, oral antibiotics if cellulitis present
- Deep incisional SSI: Involves fascia and muscle layers
  * Treatment: Requires surgical exploration, IV antibiotics, possible wound VAC
- Organ/space SSI: Infection in anatomic spaces opened/manipulated during surgery
  * Treatment: Drainage (percutaneous or surgical), IV antibiotics, prolonged therapy

Empiric Antibiotic Selection for SSI:
- Superficial SSI: Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID or cefazolin 1-2g IV every 8 hours
- MRSA risk factors: Add TMP-SMX DS twice daily or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily
- Deep SSI or organ/space: Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam, add vancomycin if MRSA risk)

====================
5. MOBILIZATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY
====================

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Principles:
- Early mobilization: Ambulate within 24 hours of most surgeries
- Benefits: Reduces DVT/PE risk, prevents pneumonia, improves bowel function, maintains muscle strength, improves mood
- Progressive activity: Sit to edge of bed → stand → walk in room → walk in hallway

Mobilization Timeline:

Day of Surgery (POD 0):
- Sit up in bed or chair for at least 30 minutes (if hemodynamically stable)
- Perform ankle pumps, leg exercises in bed
- Ambulate to chair if feasible (minimally invasive procedures)

Post-Operative Day 1:
- Sit in chair for meals
- Ambulate in hallway 3-4 times (start with short distances, progress as tolerated)
- Continue in-bed exercises

Post-Operative Days 2-3:
- Increase ambulation distance and frequency (goal: 6+ times daily by POD 3)
- Begin stair training if patient will have stairs at home
- Physical therapy consultation if complex needs or prolonged recovery expected

Specific Mobilization Protocols:

Orthopedic Surgery (Joint Replacement):
- POD 0: Physical therapy evaluation, begin exercises
- POD 1: Ambulate with assistive device, begin weight-bearing as allowed (full, partial, or non-weight-bearing per surgeon)
- POD 2-3: Progress distance, stair training, discharge planning

Abdominal Surgery:
- Early mobilization critical to prevent ileus
- Ambulate even with drains, NG tubes, or ostomies (secure appropriately)
- Gradual return to normal activities over 4-6 weeks

Cardiac Surgery:
- Sternal precautions: No pushing/pulling, no lifting > 10 lbs for 6-8 weeks
- Gradual increase in activity
- Cardiac rehabilitation referral

Fall Prevention:
- Assess fall risk: Age, medications (opioids, sedatives), orthostatic hypotension, deconditioning
- Interventions: Non-skid socks, bed alarm, frequent toileting, glasses/hearing aids, clear pathways
- Assistance: Use gait belt, walker, or cane as appropriate

====================
6. RESPIRATORY CARE
====================

Pulmonary Complications (Common Post-Op):
- Atelectasis (most common): Collapse of alveoli, typically in dependent lung regions
- Pneumonia
- Pleural effusion
- Pulmonary embolism (see below)

Prevention Strategies:

Incentive Spirometry:
- Goal: Prevent atelectasis by promoting deep breathing and lung expansion
- Technique: Inhale slowly and deeply, hold for 3-5 seconds, rest, repeat
- Frequency: 10 times every hour while awake
- Patient education: More important than achieving specific volume; focus on effort

Deep Breathing and Coughing Exercises:
- Deep breathing: Slow, deep inhalations through nose, hold, exhale slowly
- Coughing technique: Splint incision with pillow, take deep breath, cough forcefully
- "Huff" coughing for less painful mobilization of secretions

Early Mobilization (see above):
- Single most effective intervention to prevent pulmonary complications

Smoking Cessation:
- Ideally 8 weeks before surgery, but any period helps
- Continue abstinence post-operatively

Supplemental Oxygen:
- Wean as tolerated to maintain SpO2 > 92-94%
- Prolonged oxygen may reduce respiratory drive in COPD patients

Recognition of Pneumonia:
- Fever, productive cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia
- Chest X-ray: Infiltrate
- Treatment: Antibiotics (hospital-acquired vs aspiration vs community-acquired pathogen coverage)

====================
7. PREVENTION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (VTE)
====================

Risk Assessment:
- High risk procedures: Orthopedic (hip/knee replacement), cancer surgery, prolonged immobility
- Patient risk factors: Previous VTE, cancer, obesity, age > 60, thrombophilia, estrogen use

Prophylaxis Strategies:

Mechanical Prophylaxis:
- Early mobilization: Most important
- Graduated compression stockings (GCS): Thigh-high preferred
- Sequential compression devices (SCDs): Intermittent pneumatic compression while in bed
- Continue until fully ambulatory

Pharmacologic Prophylaxis (if not contraindicated):
- Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH): Enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily (30 mg twice daily if high-risk orthopedic surgery)
- Unfractionated heparin: 5000 units SC every 8-12 hours
- Factor Xa inhibitors: Fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban (specific to orthopedic surgery)
- Duration: Until fully ambulatory (inpatient); extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) for high-risk orthopedic surgery

Contraindications to Pharmacologic Prophylaxis:
- Active bleeding
- High bleeding risk (neurosurgery, ocular surgery initially)
- Platelet count < 50,000
- Severe renal impairment (adjust LMWH dose or use UFH)

DVT Recognition:
- Unilateral leg swelling, pain, warmth, erythema, positive Homan's sign (unreliable)
- Diagnosis: Duplex ultrasound
- Treatment: Anticoagulation (LMWH, fondaparinux, or direct oral anticoagulant)

Pulmonary Embolism Recognition:
- Dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, chest pain (pleuritic), hypoxia, hemoptysis
- Diagnosis: CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or V/Q scan
- Treatment: Anticoagulation, supportive care, thrombolytics or embolectomy if massive PE

====================
8. NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT AND BOWEL FUNCTION
====================

Post-Operative Diet Advancement:
- NPO initially → clear liquids → full liquids → regular diet
- Timing varies by procedure:
  * Minimally invasive surgery: Often tolerate diet POD 0 or 1
  * Major abdominal surgery: NPO until bowel function returns (flatus, bowel movement)
- ERAS protocols: Early feeding (within 24 hours) safe for many procedures

Return of Bowel Function:
- Small bowel: Returns in 24 hours
- Stomach: 24-48 hours
- Colon: 3-5 days
- Signs: Bowel sounds (early, not reliable), flatus (more reliable), bowel movement

Post-Operative Ileus (POI):
- Transient cessation of bowel motility, common after abdominal surgery
- Prevention: Early mobilization, minimize opioids, gum chewing, alvimopan (for bowel resection)
- Management: NPO, IV fluids, correct electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium), reduce opioids, NG tube if severe
- Differentiate from mechanical obstruction (requires imaging if prolonged)

Nausea and Vomiting Management:
- Common post-operative complaint
- Prophylaxis in high-risk patients: Combination therapy (ondansetron + dexamethasone + scopolamine patch)
- Treatment: Ondansetron 4-8 mg IV/PO, metoclopramide 10 mg, promethazine 12.5-25 mg, prochlorperazine 5-10 mg

Nutritional Considerations:
- Protein needs increased: 1.5-2.0 g/kg/day to promote wound healing
- Caloric needs increased: 25-30 kcal/kg/day
- Micronutrients: Vitamin C, zinc, vitamin A for wound healing
- Malnutrition screening: Assess pre-op nutritional status, consult dietitian if high risk

====================
9. PATIENT EDUCATION AND DISCHARGE PLANNING
====================

Discharge Instructions (Provide Written + Verbal):

Activity Restrictions:
- Specific to procedure (e.g., no lifting > 10-15 lbs for 4-6 weeks)
- Driving: Typically no driving while on opioids or for 1-2 weeks post-op
- Return to work: Varies by procedure and occupation (desk job vs physical labor)
- Sexual activity: Usually safe when comfortable, typically 2-4 weeks

Wound Care:
- Dressing changes if applicable
- When to shower/bathe
- Signs of infection to watch for

Medications:
- Pain management plan with weaning strategy

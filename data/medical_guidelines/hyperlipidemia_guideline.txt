CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE: HYPERLIPIDEMIA AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK MANAGEMENT

Version 2.3 | Updated: December 2024

====================
1. INTRODUCTION
====================

Dyslipidemia is a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for lipid screening, cardiovascular risk assessment, and management strategies including lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy to reduce ASCVD events.

====================
2. LIPID SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS
====================

Universal Screening:
- All adults age ≥20 years: Baseline fasting lipid panel or non-fasting non-HDL cholesterol
- Repeat screening intervals:
  * Age 20-39 without risk factors: Every 4-6 years
  * Age 40-75: Regularly as part of ASCVD risk assessment
  * Age ≥ 76: Individualized based on health status

Earlier or More Frequent Screening if:
- Family history of premature ASCVD (men < 55, women < 65)
- Family history of severe hyperlipidemia (LDL > 190 mg/dL)
- Major ASCVD risk factors: Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, chronic kidney disease
- Physical examination findings: Xanthomas, corneal arcus (< age 50)

Lipid Panel Components:
- Total cholesterol
- LDL cholesterol (calculate or direct measurement)
- HDL cholesterol
- Triglycerides
- Non-HDL cholesterol (Total cholesterol - HDL)

Interpretation of Lipid Levels:

LDL Cholesterol:
- Optimal: < 100 mg/dL (< 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients)
- Near optimal: 100-129 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 130-159 mg/dL
- High: 160-189 mg/dL
- Very high: ≥ 190 mg/dL

HDL Cholesterol:
- Low (increased risk): < 40 mg/dL in men, < 50 mg/dL in women
- Desirable: ≥ 60 mg/dL (protective)

Triglycerides:
- Normal: < 150 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 150-199 mg/dL
- High: 200-499 mg/dL
- Very high: ≥ 500 mg/dL (pancreatitis risk)

Non-HDL Cholesterol (preferred for hypertriglyceridemia):
- Optimal: < 130 mg/dL
- Above optimal: ≥ 130 mg/dL

====================
3. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT
====================

ASCVD Risk Categories:

1. Very High Risk (Secondary Prevention):
   - Clinical ASCVD: Acute coronary syndrome, MI, stable/unstable angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease
   - LDL goal: < 70 mg/dL (consider < 55 mg/dL)

2. High Risk (Primary Prevention):
   - LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL
   - Diabetes mellitus age 40-75
   - 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20% (using pooled cohort equations)
   - LDL goal: < 100 mg/dL (consider < 70 mg/dL)

3. Borderline Risk:
   - 10-year ASCVD risk 5-7.5%
   - Consider risk enhancers for statin decision

4. Low Risk:
   - 10-year ASCVD risk < 5%
   - Lifestyle modifications primary approach

Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE):
- Estimates 10-year risk of first hard ASCVD event
- Factors: Age, sex, race, total cholesterol, HDL, SBP, hypertension treatment, diabetes, smoking
- Available via online calculator or ASCVD risk estimator app
- Best validated for age 40-75; use with caution outside this range

Risk Enhancers (Consider if Risk 5-20%):
- Family history of premature ASCVD (men < 55, women < 65)
- Primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL 160-189 mg/dL)
- Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 15-59 mL/min)
- Metabolic syndrome
- Inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, HIV)
- High-risk ethnicity (South Asian)
- Premature menopause (< age 40)
- Pregnancy-related complications (preeclampsia)
- Elevated high-sensitivity CRP (≥ 2.0 mg/L)
- Lipoprotein(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL
- Apolipoprotein B ≥ 130 mg/dL
- Ankle-brachial index < 0.9
- Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score

Coronary Artery Calcium Scanning:
- Non-invasive CT scan quantifying coronary calcification
- Most useful when treatment decision unclear (borderline risk 5-20%)
- CAC = 0: Very low risk; may defer statin in selected patients
- CAC 1-99: Consider statin
- CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile for age/sex: Statin recommended

====================
4. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS - FOUNDATION OF TREATMENT
====================

Dietary Interventions:

Heart-Healthy Eating Pattern:
- Emphasize: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, lean poultry
- Limit: Red meat, processed meats, refined carbohydrates, sugar-sweetened beverages
- Mediterranean or DASH diet patterns proven effective

Specific Dietary Recommendations:
- Saturated fat: < 5-6% of total calories (replace with unsaturated fats)
- Trans fats: Eliminate from diet (avoid partially hydrogenated oils)
- Dietary cholesterol: Minimize (< 200 mg/day), though less emphasis than previously
- Omega-3 fatty acids: 2 servings fatty fish per week (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
- Plant sterols/stanols: 2 grams/day can reduce LDL by 6-10% (fortified foods or supplements)
- Soluble fiber: 10-25 grams/day (oats, barley, beans, fruits, vegetables)

Expected LDL Reduction from Diet:
- Comprehensive dietary changes can reduce LDL by 5-10%
- Weight loss of 10 kg can reduce LDL by ~8 mg/dL

Physical Activity:
- Aerobic exercise: 150 minutes/week moderate intensity (or 75 minutes vigorous)
- Resistance training: 2-3 sessions per week
- Benefits: Raises HDL (3-5 mg/dL), lowers triglycerides (20-30 mg/dL), modest LDL reduction

Weight Management:
- Weight loss improves lipid profile: Increases HDL, decreases LDL and triglycerides
- Target BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- Even 5-10% body weight loss yields metabolic benefits

Smoking Cessation:
- Critical intervention: Smoking lowers HDL and increases ASCVD risk
- Offer pharmacotherapy (varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement) plus counseling

Alcohol Consumption:
- Moderate consumption may raise HDL
- Excess alcohol raises triglycerides significantly
- Recommendation: Men ≤ 2 drinks/day, women ≤ 1 drink/day
- Avoid alcohol if triglycerides very elevated (> 500 mg/dL)

====================
5. STATIN THERAPY - CORNERSTONE OF PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT
====================

Statin Benefit Groups (2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines):

1. Clinical ASCVD:
   - High-intensity statin recommended (aim for ≥ 50% LDL reduction)
   - Continue indefinitely unless contraindicated

2. Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL):
   - High-intensity statin recommended
   - Start age ≥ 20 years

3. Diabetes mellitus age 40-75:
   - Moderate-intensity statin recommended
   - High-intensity if additional ASCVD risk factors or 10-year risk ≥ 20%

4. Primary prevention with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% (age 40-75):
   - Moderate- to high-intensity statin recommended
   - Risk discussion with clinician-patient shared decision-making

Statin Intensity Classifications:

High-Intensity Statins (LDL reduction ≥ 50%):
- Atorvastatin 40-80 mg
- Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg

Moderate-Intensity Statins (LDL reduction 30-49%):
- Atorvastatin 10-20 mg
- Rosuvastatin 5-10 mg
- Simvastatin 20-40 mg
- Pravastatin 40-80 mg
- Lovastatin 40 mg
- Fluvastatin 80 mg
- Pitavastatin 1-4 mg

Low-Intensity Statins (LDL reduction < 30%):
- Simvastatin 10 mg
- Pravastatin 10-20 mg
- Lovastatin 20 mg
- Fluvastatin 20-40 mg

Statin Administration:
- Take in evening or bedtime (cholesterol synthesis peaks at night)
- Can be taken without regard to meals
- Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have long half-lives (any time of day acceptable)

Monitoring Statin Therapy:
- Baseline: Lipid panel, ALT
- Follow-up lipid panel: 4-12 weeks after initiation or dose change
- Routine ALT monitoring: Not recommended unless symptoms develop
- Check CK only if muscle symptoms occur
- Reassess adherence and lifestyle if LDL not at goal

Statin Side Effects and Management:

Muscle-Related Symptoms (Most Common):
- Incidence: 10-15% of patients report myalgias
- Spectrum: Mild myalgias to rare rhabdomyolysis
- Evaluation: Check CK if significant symptoms (stop statin if CK > 10x ULN)
- Management strategies:
  * Lower dose of same statin
  * Different statin (some patients tolerate alternative statins)
  * Alternate-day dosing or twice-weekly dosing
  * Coenzyme Q10 supplementation (200-400 mg/day) - mixed evidence
  * Vitamin D supplementation if deficient

Hepatotoxicity:
- Mild ALT elevation common but usually transient
- Discontinue statin if ALT > 3x upper limit of normal and persistent
- Recheck ALT 4-6 weeks after discontinuation

New-Onset Diabetes:
- Small increased risk (10-12% relative increase) with high-intensity statins
- CV benefits far outweigh diabetes risk in appropriate patients
- Monitor glucose in at-risk patients (prediabetes, metabolic syndrome)

Cognitive Effects:
- No evidence of significant cognitive impairment from statins
- FDA warning about confusion/memory loss, but causality unclear

Contraindications to Statins:
- Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevation
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Hypersensitivity to statin components

====================
6. NON-STATIN LIPID-LOWERING THERAPIES
====================

Ezetimibe (Zetia):
- Mechanism: Inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption
- Dosing: 10 mg daily
- LDL reduction: 15-20% (additive to statins)
- Indications: Add to statin if not at LDL goal; alternative if statin intolerant
- Evidence: IMPROVE-IT trial showed reduced CV events when added to statin in post-ACS patients
- Side effects: Generally well-tolerated, rare GI symptoms
- Cost: Moderate (generic available)

PCSK9 Inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab):
- Mechanism: Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PCSK9, increasing LDL receptor recycling
- Dosing: Subcutaneous injection every 2-4 weeks
- LDL reduction: 50-60% (even on background statin)
- Indications:
  * Clinical ASCVD not at goal on maximally tolerated statin + ezetimibe
  * Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with LDL ≥ 100 on maximal therapy
  * Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
- Evidence: FOURIER and ODYSSEY trials showed 15% reduction in major CV events
- Side effects: Injection site reactions, rare myalgias
- Cost: Very high ($$$), often requires insurance pre-authorization

Bempedoic Acid (Nexletol):
- Mechanism: Inhibits ATP citrate lyase (upstream of HMG-CoA reductase)
- Dosing: 180 mg daily
- LDL reduction: 15-25% (additive to statins)
- Indications: Add-on therapy or for statin-intolerant patients
- Evidence: CLEAR Outcomes trial showed 13% reduction in major CV events
- Side effects: Generally well-tolerated, hyperuricemia (gout risk), tendon rupture (rare)
- Advantage: No muscle-related side effects (prodrug activated in liver, not muscle)
- Cost: High

Icosapent Ethyl (Vascepa):
- Mechanism: High-purity EPA (omega-3 fatty acid) - mechanism debated
- Dosing: 2 grams twice daily with meals
- Triglyceride reduction: 15-20%
- Indications: Patients with triglycerides 150-499 mg/dL on statin with ASCVD or diabetes plus ≥ 2 risk factors
- Evidence: REDUCE-IT trial showed 25% reduction in major CV events
- Side effects: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, bleeding (minor)
- Cost: High (recently generic available)

Fibrates (Fenofibrate, Gemfibrozil):
- Mechanism: PPAR-alpha agonists, primarily lower triglycerides and raise HDL
- Dosing: Fenofibrate 48-145 mg daily; Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily
- Triglyceride reduction: 30-50%, HDL increase: 10-20%, modest LDL reduction
- Indications: Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis
- Evidence: Limited CV benefit in recent trials except possibly in diabetics with low HDL/high TG
- Side effects: Myopathy (especially with statins), GI symptoms, gallstones
- Drug interactions: Avoid gemfibrozil with statins (significant myopathy risk); fenofibrate safer with statins
- Cost: Low (generic available)

Bile Acid Sequestrants (Cholestyramine, Colesevelam):
- Mechanism: Bind bile acids in intestine, increase LDL receptor expression
- LDL reduction: 15-25%
- Indications: Rarely used; option for statin-intolerant patients
- Side effects: GI symptoms (bloating, constipation), reduced absorption of other medications
- Cost: Moderate

Niacin (Nicotinic Acid):
- Previously used for low HDL; recent trials (AIM-HIGH, HPS2-THRIVE) showed no CV benefit
- No longer recommended due to lack of efficacy and side effects (flushing, hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity)

====================
7. SPECIAL LIPID SCENARIOS
====================

Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL):
- Primary goal: Reduce pancreatitis risk (occurs when TG > 1000 mg/dL)
- Initial approach:
  * Very low-fat diet (< 15% calories from fat)
  * Eliminate alcohol
  * Control secondary causes: diabetes, obesity, medications
  * Fibrate therapy (fenofibrate preferred)
- Once TG < 500: Reassess LDL and consider statin therapy
- Severe cases may require omega-3 fatty acids (prescription high-dose EPA/DHA)

Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH):
- Suspect if: LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, family history of premature ASCVD, xanthomas, corneal arcus (young age)
- Heterozygous FH (1 in 250): LDL typically 190-400 mg/dL
- Homozygous FH (1 in 300,000): LDL > 400 mg/dL, extremely high risk
- Treatment:
  * High-intensity statin + ezetimibe
  * Add PCSK9 inhibitor if not at goal (LDL < 100, ideally < 70)
  * Consider family cascade screening
  * Homozygous FH may require LDL apheresis or lomitapide

Low HDL Cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL):
- Address secondary causes: Smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, medications (beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics)
- Lifestyle: Exercise most effective intervention to raise HDL (3-6 mg/dL increase possible)
- Pharmacotherapy: No specific proven therapy to raise HDL and reduce CV events
- Focus on LDL reduction rather than HDL raising

Metabolic Syndrome:
- Criteria (≥ 3 of 5): Waist circumference > 40 in (men) or > 35 in (women); TG ≥ 150; HDL < 40 (men) or < 50 (women); BP ≥ 130/85; fasting glucose ≥ 100
- Management: Weight loss, physical activity, DASH diet
- Lipid profile typically: Elevated TG, low HDL, small dense LDL particles
- Statin recommended if 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%

Chronic Kidney Disease:
- Statin recommended in adults ≥ 50 years with eGFR < 60 mL/min (not on dialysis)
- Benefit less clear in dialysis patients; generally continue if already on statin
- Dose adjustment not typically required for statins (except atorvastatin in severe CKD)

====================
8. MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP
====================

Follow-Up Lipid Testing:
- Check 4-12 weeks after statin initiation or dose change
- If at goal: Recheck annually
- If not at goal: Reassess adherence, intensify therapy, check every 3-6 months

Adherence Assessment:
- Statin non-adherence common (~50% at one year)
- Barriers: Cost, side effect concerns, lack of symptoms, polypharmacy
- Strategies: Simplify regimen, address side effects, patient education, medication synchronization

Treatment Targets:
- Primary goal: Percent LDL reduction (30-50% or ≥ 50% depending on statin intensity)
- Secondary: Absolute LDL thresholds (< 70 mg/dL for very high risk, < 100 mg/dL for high risk)
- Non-HDL cholesterol: Alternative target (add 30 to LDL goal)

====================
9. PATIENT EDUCATION
====================

Key Discussion Points:
- ASCVD risk explanation: "Your risk of heart attack or stroke over 10 years"
- Benefits of therapy: "Statins reduce your risk by 25-35%"
- Lifestyle importance: "Diet and exercise work together with medications"
- Long-term commitment: "This is lifelong treatment, like blood pressure medication"
- Safety: "Statins are among the most studied drugs; serious side effects are rare"
- Report muscle symptoms promptly for evaluation

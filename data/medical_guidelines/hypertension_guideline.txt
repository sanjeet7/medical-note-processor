CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE: HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT IN PRIMARY CARE

Version 2.1 | Updated: December 2024

====================
1. INTRODUCTION
====================

Hypertension remains one of the most prevalent chronic conditions worldwide, affecting approximately 1.28 billion adults globally. It is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and mortality. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of hypertension in adult patients in primary care settings.

====================
2. DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION
====================

Blood Pressure Measurement Standards:
- Measurements should be taken after the patient has been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes
- Use appropriate cuff size (bladder encircling at least 80% of arm)
- Take at least two readings 1-2 minutes apart
- Confirm diagnosis with out-of-office measurements (home BP monitoring or ambulatory BP monitoring)

Classification of Blood Pressure in Adults (ACC/AHA 2017):
- Normal: SBP < 120 mm Hg AND DBP < 80 mm Hg
- Elevated: SBP 120-129 mm Hg AND DBP  < 80 mm Hg
- Stage 1 Hypertension: SBP 130-139 mm Hg OR DBP 80-89 mm Hg
- Stage 2 Hypertension: SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg OR DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg

Diagnostic Confirmation:
- Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the gold standard for confirming diagnosis
- Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is an acceptable alternative
- At least 12-14 measurements over one week recommended for HBPM
- Exclude white coat hypertension (elevated office BP, normal out-of-office BP)
- Exclude masked hypertension (normal office BP, elevated out-of-office BP)

====================
3. INITIAL EVALUATION
====================

History and Physical Examination:
- Duration of hypertension and previous BP readings
- Symptoms of target organ damage (chest pain, dyspnea, neurological symptoms)
- Cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, family history
- Secondary hypertension screening: young age, severe/resistant HTN, hypokalemia
- Medication review: NSAIDs, decongestants, oral contraceptives, steroids

Laboratory Testing:
- Basic metabolic panel (sodium, potassium, creatinine, eGFR)
- Fasting lipid panel
- Fasting glucose or HbA1c
- Urinalysis (proteinuria assessment)
- ECG (left ventricular hypertrophy screening)

Optional Testing Based on Clinical Suspicion:
- TSH (thyroid disorders)
- Renin/aldosterone ratio (primary aldosteronism)
- Plasma metanephrines (pheochromocytoma)
- Renal artery imaging (renovascular hypertension)

====================
4. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS
====================

All patients with elevated blood pressure or hypertension should receive counseling on lifestyle modifications, which can reduce SBP by 4-11 mm Hg:

Dietary Interventions:
- DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension): emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins
- Sodium restriction: limit to < 1500-2300 mg per day
- Potassium supplementation: 3500-5000 mg daily (unless contraindicated)  
- Limit alcohol: men ≤ 2 drinks/day, women ≤ 1 drink/day

Physical Activity:
- Aerobic exercise: 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity OR 75 minutes/week of vigorous intensity
- Resistance training: 2-3 sessions per week
- Combination approaches preferred for optimal BP reduction

Weight Management:
- Target BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- Weight loss goal: 1 kg reduction can lower SBP by ~1 mm Hg
- Emphasis on sustainable dietary and exercise habits

Stress Reduction:
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours nightly)
- Limit caffeine intake
- Smoking cessation (critical for overall CV risk reduction)

====================
5. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT
====================

Indications for Medication Initiation:
- Stage 2 hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90): initiate medication immediately alongside lifestyle modifications
- Stage 1 hypertension (BP 130-139/80-89): consider medication if:
  * 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%
  * Presence of diabetes mellitus
  * Chronic kidney disease
  * Age ≥ 65 years

Blood Pressure Treatment Goals:
- General population: < 130/80 mm Hg
- Age ≥ 65 years: < 130/80 mm Hg (if tolerated)
- Diabetes mellitus: < 130/80 mm Hg
- Chronic kidney disease: < 130/80 mm Hg

First-Line Antihypertensive Medications:

1. Thiazide or Thiazide-Like Diuretics
   - Examples: Chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg daily, Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Reduces plasma volume and peripheral vascular resistance
   - Cautions: Monitor electrolytes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia), uric acid elevation
   - Contraindications: Gout, severe hyponatremia

2. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors
   - Examples: Lisinopril 10-40 mg daily, Enalapril 5-20 mg twice daily
   - Mechanism: Blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II
   - Preferred in: Diabetes with proteinuria, heart failure, post-MI
   - Cautions: Monitor creatinine and potassium; check within 1-2 weeks of initiation
   - Contraindications: Pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis, history of angioedema
   - Side effects: Dry cough (5-10%), hyperkalemia

3. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
   - Examples: Losartan 50-100 mg daily, Valsartan 80-320 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Blocks angiotensin II type 1 receptors
   - Preferred in: Patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors (cough)
   - Same indications and cautions as ACE inhibitors
   - Contraindications: Pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis

4. Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)
   - Dihydropyridines: Amlodipine 5-10 mg daily, Nifedipine XL 30-90 mg daily
     * Side effects: Peripheral edema, headache
   - Non-dihydropyridines: Diltiazem CD 180-360 mg daily, Verapamil SR 120-480 mg daily
     * Cautions: Avoid in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
   - Preferred in: Elderly patients, Black patients, chronic kidney disease without proteinuria

Treatment Algorithms:
- Most patients require 2-3 medications for BP control
- Initial monotherapy: Consider for Stage 1 HTN with low CV risk
- Initial dual therapy: Recommended for Stage 2 HTN or average BP > 20/10 mm Hg above goal
- Preferred combinations:
  * ACE inhibitor or ARB + CCB
  * ACE inhibitor or ARB + thiazide diuretic
  * CCB + thiazide diuretic

Second-Line and Resistant Hypertension:
- Beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, carvedilol): Consider for specific indications (CAD, HF, tachyarrhythmias)
- Spironolactone 25-50 mg daily: Effective add-on for resistant HTN
- Alpha-blockers (doxazosin): Reserved for specific situations
- Direct vasodilators (hydralazine, minoxidil): Reserved for resistant cases
- Resistant HTN definition: Uncontrolled BP despite 3 medications including a diuretic

====================
6. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
====================

Black Patients:
- Higher prevalence and severity of hypertension
- Initial therapy: Thiazide diuretic or CCB preferred over ACE inhibitor/ARB
- Lower renin activity makes ACE inhibitors less effective as monotherapy
- Combination therapy often required

Pregnant Women:
- Chronic HTN: Continue antihypertensive therapy (avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs)
- Safe options: Methyldopa, labetalol, long-acting nifedipine
- Gestational HTN/Preeclampsia: Requires specialist consultation
- Target BP: < 140/90 during pregnancy

Elderly Patients (Age ≥ 65):
- Higher prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension
- Benefits of treatment well-established
- Target SBP < 130 mm Hg if tolerated
- Caution with orthostatic hypotension: check standing BP
- Start low, titrate slowly in frail elderly

Diabetes Mellitus:
- Higher CV risk; aggressive BP control important
- Target: < 130/80 mm Hg
- Preferred agents: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (renoprotective)
- Monitor for hyperkalemia, especially if eGFR < 60

Chronic Kidney Disease:
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred (reduce proteinuria progression)
- Target: < 130/80 mm Hg
- Monitor creatinine and potassium closely
- Accept up to 30% increase in creatinine after initiation
- Avoid ACE/ARB if eGFR < 30 without specialist input

====================
7. MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP
====================

Initial Follow-Up:
- Reassess BP within 1 month of medication initiation or dose adjustment
- More frequent follow-up (1-2 weeks) if Stage 2 HTN or symptoms
- Monitor for side effects and medication adherence

Long-Term Monitoring:
- Once BP controlled: follow-up every 3-6 months
- Annual laboratory monitoring: BMP, lipids, urinalysis
- Home blood pressure monitoring encouraged
- Self-measured BP average of 130/80 corresponds to office goal of 130/80

Adherence Strategies:
- Simplify regimen: once-daily dosing, combination pills
- Address barriers: cost, side effects, health literacy
- Regular medication reconciliation
- Utilize pharmacists, nurses for education and support
